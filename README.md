# The-VBA-of-Wall-Street
Using VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data for year 2014-2016.

## Files
 * Stock Data - Data to generate the final Report.

## Stock Market analysis:
1. Creating the script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.
  * The ticker symbol.
  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The total stock volume of the stock.

2. Implemented conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

3. Our solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
